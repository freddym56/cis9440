This project builds an ETL pipeline using data from Kaggle and loading it into Oracle Autonomous database.

Install requirements. I suggest using a virtual environment to avoid breaking your default Python install.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up your Oracle autonomous db account and install the Oracle instant client basic. You can follow instructions at the link below.

Need to add the following environment variables via your system shell.

```
export oracle_client=path_to_your_oracle_client
export oracle_user=your_oracle_autonomous_db_username
export oracle_password=your_oracle_autonomous_db_password
```

You will also have to set up your Kaggle credentials. 
The API needs a configuration to use. 
The simplest one is perhaps to write a kaggle.json file under the ".kaggle" folder in your home directory.
